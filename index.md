Hello! I am **Andrew Pham (Bold)** and I am a second-year at the *University of California San Diego (Italicized)*  who plans to graduate in ~~3 years (Crossed Out)~~ 4 years!

I hope to also gain experience in system design, CD/CI, and software engineering (in general). I am still unsure of my career path and am exploring; in essence, I am open to *** learn and grow by facing complex challenges (Bold and Italicized)*** !
