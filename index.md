Hello! I am **Andrew Pham (Bold)** and I am a second-year at the *University of California San Diego (Italicized)*  who plans to graduate in ~~3 years (Crossed Out)~~ 4 years! I hope to work in a productive and innovative team and learn to be a **_Software (Nested Bold and Italicized)_ Engineer** . I hope to also gain experience in system design, CD/CI, and software engineering (in general). I am still unsure of my career path and am exploring; in essence, I am open to ***learn and grow by facing complex challenges (Bold and Italicized)*** !

My favorite quote from a movie:

How to print in Java (my favorite language for now):
```
System.out.println()
